<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>In addition to my medical career, I hold an MBA in hospital administration, which has provided me with a unique perspective on healthcare management. My journey into the world of coding began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, eventually leading me to master advanced programming languages like Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and dAPP.</p>

<p>Now, as a part-time full-stack developer, I enjoy creating seamless digital solutions that blend my medical background with cutting-edge technology. This new chapter in my career allows me to explore innovative ways to improve healthcare through the power of web development.</p>
